        Hi again ðŸ‘‹, I'm Zaccheaus Yisa. I'm a Frontend Devloper, I enjoy
        building web based solutions and trying out new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started learning programming because as kid I enjoyed playing video
        games and i wanted to know how they were made so I make my own games. I
        began searching the internet for information on how games are made then
        I came across the game engine <strong>Unity</strong>. Unity was just a
        child's dream.

        In 2020 when the virus struck, I had a lot of time to learning what
        programming and software development was. I started out learning HTML
        and ever since I have fallen in love with thhs career of creating beauty
        and magic.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I am not coding, I try to learn new stuff to keep myself upto speed
        with the ever evolving Tech industry. I enjoy playing and watching
        basketball, chess and Animes
